## About

Hi, I'm Seth!

I am a back-end software engineer with a passion for engineering and creation. I have over 10 years of business ownership and construction experience as a licensed professional metal fabricator.  I started my journey into software while attending [Turing School of Software & Design][turing]'s Back-End Engineering program in 2021.

As a software engineer and fabricator I developed a deep love with building, creating and watching your work come to life. I enjoy the process of fine tuning and tweaking until something is perfect. Alas it never is, which translates to my drive never stops.

When I'm not coding, you will find me playing with my son, snowboarding/skateboarding or hiking.

Feel free to take a peak at my work and reach out!
